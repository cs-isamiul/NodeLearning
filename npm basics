visit the npm website, this is like gems in ruby

//installed locally for the current project
npm i <packagename>

//installed globally. Useable in every project
npm install -g <packagename>


//you need package.json - manifest file that stores important info about the project/package
*you can manually create package.json in the root, but you must create and configure properties yourself
*"npm init" will do things step by step and allow you to configure the package.json file
*"npm init -y" will set up package.json with default settings

//install package as a dev dependency for use during development
npm i <packagename> -D

//uninstall a package
npm uninstall <packagename>

finally, for a new project, if you do not have node_modules but package.json exists, simply run "npm install"

===================
Example using lodash below.
make sure to use "npm i lodash" before running
===================
const _ = require("lodash");

const items = [1,[2,[3,[4]]]];
const newItems = _.flattenDeep(items);

console.log(newItems);
